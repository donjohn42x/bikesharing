# bikesharing

## Overview of analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to use data visualiztions to answer a set of questions pertaining to our bikesharing project idea. In gathering the data and creating visualizations, we can send a message to our viewers about what that data can tell us. In this analysis, we are to share our visualizations to investors and create a story using the tools that tableau provides.The story will answer a some questions about the data that might help them understand validity of this idea and hopefully bring investors onboard.

## Results
[link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dominic4796/viz/Bikesharing_16448111392530/Story1?publish=yes)

- The first story point shows the number of bike rides per duration and the data seems to show that many bike rides tend to be for about 5-10 minutes
- The second story point takes the previous measures and divides them by gender. We can see that most of the bike rides are done by men
- The third story point shows a heatmap of the hours start time by the stop time, showing us much darker colors around the evening time meaning that many people like to ride during these hours
- The fourth story point divides the idea of the previous one by Gender, again showing that men mostly bike at these times and compared to women.
- The fifth story point shows that many of the subscribers are male and seem to mostly bike on Thursdays as shown in the darkness of the thrusday block
- The sixth story the amount of bike rides per hour of the day, showing us that a large number of people like to bike at 8am (maybe before their workday starts) and around 6-8pm (after the workday ends)
- The final story point shows a heat map of which individual bikes are used most often. This information can be useful in determining which bikes may need maintanence

## Summary
In summary, the visualizations have showed us the time that most people would like to ride, and that men are the biggest customers which many be important in marketing and understanding customers. Two additional visualiztions that we may suggest can be one to answer the question of how many subscribers are men and how many are women, and another visualization to answer the question of which routes are most taken by customers (i.e, staring and ending locations)
